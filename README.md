# PokeDex Playground

This is a pet project I (Grant Sander) created to explore [GridsomeJS](https://gridsome.org/) and [the PokeAPI](https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokeapi). I accidentally fell in love with Gridsome in the process and took this further than I originally anticipated.

## Tools used

- [GridsomeJS](https://gridsome.org/) for building out the site.
- [VuetifyJS](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) as a component library.
- [The PokeAPI](https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokeapi) for the Pokemon data.
- [Pokemon SVG](https://github.com/jnovack/pokemon-svg) for the SVG images of the Pokemon.
- [Sharp](https://github.com/lovell/sharp) and [Node Vibrant](https://github.com/akfish/node-vibrant/) for extracting colors from the SVG images in the site.
