# PokeDex Playground

This is a pet project I (Grant Sander) created to explore [GridsomeJS](https://gridsome.org/) and [the PokeAPI](https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokeapi). I accidentally fell in love with Gridsome in the process and took this further than I originally anticipated.

## Tools used

- [GridsomeJS](https://gridsome.org/) for building out the site.
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.
- [The PokeAPI](https://github.com/PokeAPI/pokeapi) for the Pokemon data.
- [Pokemon SVG](https://github.com/jnovack/pokemon-svg) for the SVG images of the Pokemon.
- [Sharp](https://github.com/lovell/sharp) and [Node Vibrant](https://github.com/akfish/node-vibrant/) for extracting colors from the SVG images in the site.

## TODO:

- [x] Sticky header that doesn't suck on mobile
- [x] Search page
- [x] SVG graphics for stats on Pokemon page
- [ ] On pokemon page, maybe some sort of floating bottom nav for navigating between pokemon
- [x] Less shitty evolution buckets.
