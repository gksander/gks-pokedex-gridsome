## Pokemon Images

The source of these images came [from this repo](https://github.com/jnovack/pokemon-svg). Here's how I used them:

- Pulled the SVGs from the aforementioned repo.
- Used [Sharp](https://github.com/lovell/sharp) to convert them to PNG.
- Used Gridsome's progressive image capabilities to display the PNGs.
